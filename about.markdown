Hi, I'm Ravi, a Toronto-based tech worker.  In the last 10+ years in the industry I've worn many hats, including:

- Full-Stack Developer
- Sysadmin
- Scrum Master
- Solutions Architect
- Development Manager

This blog is one part my way to formulate thoughts on engineering topics I find interesting, and one part my commitment to writing more.
